# Stata Commands under Development

This README lists Stata commands I am developing.  
Please note: the following repositories are **private**.

- `didselect`: Stata module to implement the selection correction estimation for heterogeneous treatment effects.
- `roy_specification`: Stata module to implement a specification test for parametric Roy models.
- `did_imputation_wild`: Stata module to implement wild bootstrap inference for treatment effect estimators with high-dimensional fixed effects.

 **The source code is available upon request**.
